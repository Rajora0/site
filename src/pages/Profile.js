            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I have a degree in Physics from UNIFEI and recently completed a postgraduate program in Data Science and Big Data at PUC Minas. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Astrophysics, with a focus on Data Science. I work as a Data Scientist at ZENVIA, where I have the opportunity to explore advanced techniques in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other areas related to Data Science, applied to various complex and challenging problems. I primarily use the Python language to develop my analyses and models, along with specific libraries and tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.</p>

                    <p>Undergraduate Thesis: MACHINE LEARNING IN GALAXY CLASSIFICATION</p>
                    <p>Galaxy classification is often a complicated process as it is mostly based on visual morphological type, which implies a time-consuming visual classification process due to the large number of galaxies. In order to facilitate this classification, we aim to teach a machine capable of labeling these objects, enabling quick and direct analysis.</p>
