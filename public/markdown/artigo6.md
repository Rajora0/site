# Image Classification Models: An Overview with Example Implementation

Image classification is one of the most vital tasks in the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). It plays a pivotal role in various sectors such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, security systems, and social networks. This article provides an exposure of image classification models and their implementations.

## Introduction

Image classification refers to the task of extracting information classes from a multiband raster image. It assigns a label to an image from a fixed set of categories ([Sharma et al., 2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-6695-0_33)). The development of image classification algorithms comprises two strategies: classical machine learning algorithms and modern methods based on deep learning.

## Classical Machine Learning Algorithms

Many classical machine learning algorithms have been applied to image classification, including Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) ([Zhang et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959387/)).

While these traditional methods have been successful in many applications, they typically require handcrafted features and are restricted in handling multi-scale objects present in images.

## Deep Learning Models

Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in image classification tasks because of their ability to learn high-level features from the data.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNN is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from tasks with image inputs ([Krizhevsky, Sutskever & Hinton, 2012](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)). The distinctive feature of CNNs is their ability to use minimal preprocessing, reducing the dependency on feature extraction.

### Transfer Learning

Transfer Learning is a popular deep learning approach where pre-trained models are extracted and fine-tuned on a different but related problem. In this process, layers from the original model, often an ImageNet pre-trained model like VGG16, ResNet50, are used and new layers suitable to the task are added.

## Implementation Example

We'll implement image classification by using a pre-trained TensorFlow's ResNet50 model.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50, decode_predictions, preprocess_input
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

 
def load_image(img_path):
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    x = image.img_to_array(img)
    x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
    x = preprocess_input(x)
    return x

IMG_PATH = 'elephant.jpg'
img = load_image(IMG_PATH)

model = ResNet50(weights="imagenet")
preds = model.predict(img)

print('Predicted:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])

```

In this example, we're using ResNet50 model to classify an elephant image. The `load_image` function processes the image, the model makes a prediction, and `decode_predictions` displays the top 3 predicted classes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are numerous image classification models available ranging from classical machine learning algorithms to more advanced deep learning models. Choosing which model to use largely depends on the complexity of tasks and the amount of labeled data available. However, deep learning models, especially those using transfer learning, offer superb performance on large scale image datasets.

For more specific use cases and complementary approaches, it is recommended to refer to more specialist resources and appropriate literature.
