# Sentiment Analysis: Concept, Implementation and Usage

Sentiment analysis, otherwise known as opinion mining, is an area of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence that focuses on identifying and extracting subjective information from source materials. This article delves into the concept of sentiment analysis, presents a simple implementation example in Python, and discusses its usage in the real world.

## Concept

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. Its primary use is to identify customer attitudes towards products, brands or services in online conversations and feedback. 

Most sentiment analysis methods focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) but also can be extended to include context-specific emotional reactions (happy, sad, etc.) or subjective states (uncertain, active, etc.).

According to a research paper published by Pang and Lee (2008), "sentiment analysis involves natural language processing because it deals with human-written text, and machine learning to automate training processes for large amounts of data."

## Implementation Example

This following is a simple example of how sentiment analysis can be performed using Python’s Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). Kindly note, this is a very basic example which uses NLTK's built-in sentiment analysis engine called Vader Sentiment. Depending on the requirement you may need to train more robust and sophisticated models.

```python
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Initialize VADER
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Text 
text = "I absolutely love this place. Great service and amazing food."

# Apply VADER
polarity = sia.polarity_scores(text)

print(polarity)
```

VADER sentiment analysis tool returns a dictionary that contains: 

- pos: The probability that the sentiment of the text is positive
- neu: The probability that the sentiment of the text is neutral
- neg: The probability that the sentiment of the text is negative
- compound: The compound score of the text, that is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules and then normalized

## Usage

Sentiment analysis has many useful applications across various industries. 

1. **Brand Monitoring:** Companies can use sentiment analysis to understand how customers perceive their brand and products. This can help businesses improve their offerings and address any negative sentiments.

2. **Product Reviews:** Sentiment analysis allows businesses to automate the process of analyzing product reviews. This helps brands discover the features their customers value most and areas where improvement is needed.

3. **Customer Support:** Sentiment analysis can be used to prioritize customer service tasks. For example, negative mentions can be addressed sooner to improve the customer experience.

In conclusion, sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding consumer behaviors and attitudes. With a wide range of potential applications in industries from marketing to customer service, it’s an essential technique for businesses to master.
